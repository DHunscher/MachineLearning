If you click on the project.html link, you will see the HTML source made to look pretty (a github feature apparently).

To view the HTML file as a web page follow this link:

https://dhunscher.github.io/grandmaster/index.html

Source file is project.Rmd in this repository. In the gh-pages branch, project.html was renamed to index.html, but is the same file.
