machine learning notes

Medical testing example:

True positive = Sick people correctly diagnosed as sick

False positive= Healthy people incorrectly identified as sick

True negative = Healthy people correctly identified as healthy

False negative = Sick people incorrectly identified as healthy.

						actual
				+				-

prediction

+				TP				FP		|	all predicted positives


_				FN				TN		|	all predicted negatives

			=========================
			all actual 		all actual
			positives		negatives
			
sensitivity = TP / all actual positives  or TP/(TP+FN)
specificity = TN / all actual negatives  or TN/(FP+TN)

positive predictive value or PPV
			= TP/ all predicted positives or TP/(TP+FP)
			
negative predictive value or NPV
			= TN/ all predicted negatives or TN/(TN+FN)
			
accuracy = all true predictions / all predictions
			or (TP + TN) / (TP+FP+TN+FN)
			

Preprocessing
=============

covariates == features == predictors

dummyVars creates object that the predict function uses to change categorical to logical 

nearZeroVar identifies which variables have enough variation to be useful as predictors

** create covariates on test set using same methods/params as used to fit training set

see Rmd on covariate creation - last slide has some links to look at
